# ðŸŽ¨ Layout
### 1. Padding
Generally speaking we use a padding of **10px** on all wrapper to achieve an unified look. This include both horizontal and vertical. The only exception we have is for the menu which is **15px** horizontally.

### 2. Margin
As with padding we use a similar layout. Between elements there should be a **10px or multiply of 5** distance if not specifically defined below.

### 3. Widths
Generally speaking we will use percentage widths to make it as responsive as possible. We focus on a viewport of approximately **320px - 480px** in width (which cover most modern phones).

### 4. Important heights
* Normal button - **64px**
* Small button - **48px**
* Menu - **64px**
* Submenu - **40px**
* Alert popup - **60px**
